# Examining the Impact of Haptic Juiciness on Illusions of Agency
### A project by Arya Sinha, Marium Ahmed and Yuk Yi Wong

Digital interfaces have become increasingly responsive in recent years. From the gentle tap after an Apple Pay transaction to curated feeds on social media platforms, companies are striving to deliver more immersive and personalized experiences to users. 

In descriptive terms, our project observes the impact of haptic feedback on a user’s perception on their actions and decisions in a virtual environment. Haptic juiciness is a term that merges haptics with the concept of ‘game juice’. Game juice refers to the added in-game feedback that brings a greater sense of immersion and satisfaction to the player experience. Combined, haptic juiciness refers to deliberate tactile designs engineered to maximize user engagement with the digital device and/or interface. Meanwhile, the sense of agency refers to when a user feels in control of their actions. With illusions of agency, users falsely attribute digital influences to their own inclinations.

To enable this exploration, we constructed a gamified simulation environment on Godot Engine 4.3 (beta). In this simulation, the user is tasked to use a DualSense controller to traverse a maze, which takes the form of a house. The goal is to find and interact with a unique object: a yellow rubber ducky. During this journey, the user encounters rooms with various interactable objects. Haptic feedback on the controller is triggered through interactions. There are two possible endings to the simulation: 1) user finds the rubber ducky; 2) user runs out of time and the simulation ends.

The completed environment will be used for user studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data on user interaction and performance. We take curiosity as a proponent for analyzing the user’s sense of agency.
